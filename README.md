Nonograms
=========

A little nonogram game made with CoffeeScript + Node.js + Expressjs + MongoDB + Raphaël, made in my free time to learn the 
basics of those technologies. If you don't know what a Nonogram AKA Picross is, check [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram).

Code is written in CoffeeScript, over a Node.js + Expressjs backend. Nonograms are stored in a MongoDB database,
and rendered on the client using Raphaël, a SVG JS library.
